# Amazon-Homepage-clone-Html-Css-
This project replicates the layout and design of Amazon's main landing page, including the header, navigation bar, hero section, and product showcases. It is intended for educational purposes and front-end practice.
You can choose the images as per your requirement
Its my first project so it is not responsive but it is pretty accurate when opened in a big screen
The interface is similar to original and looks attractive
